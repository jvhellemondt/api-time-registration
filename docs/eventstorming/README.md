# Event Storming

For this project, we are using Event Storming to explore and design our domain model collaboratively. This approach helps us visualize key business events, understand workflows, and identify bounded contexts.

## Miro

We facilitate our Event Storming sessions using Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard tool that allows real-time brainstorming, sticky note organization, and structured domain modeling. With Miro, we can efficiently map out events, commands, aggregates, and policies, ensuring a shared understanding across the team.
